Websites
--------

Github
~~~~~~

We will use Github_ as the main website for the course.
It will also contain all of the documents for the course, such as labs and homework.

The versions of documents found on Github are the canonical versions of all documents.
Other downloaded versions of documents may become out of date.
If I make changes to those documents, they will appear first on Github.

Canvas
~~~~~~

We will be using Canvas_ for assignment submission and grade distribution.

Gradescope
~~~~~~~~~~

We will use Gradescope_ for returning quizzes, the midterm, and the final.
Gradescope gives you a graded PDF version of your test, along with a rubric, immediately after we're done grading.
You will receive an email from Gradescope to make your account after we grade the first quiz.

Piazza
~~~~~~

We will use Piazza_ for class discussions outside of the classroom.
Odds are, you've used Piazza for another class, but it will serve as the discussion board.
Both the TA and I will be on Piazza to answer questions.

It's best to ask your questions on Piazza.
That way, all of your classmates can see the answer instead of emailing the TAs or me.
Additionally, you may get a faster response from one of your classmates.

Through asking and answering questions on Piazza, you improve your understanding of the material, and improve other students' understanding as well.
As an incentive to answer other students' questions and participate, I will drop your lowest quiz score if you consistently participate on Piazza.
I will check Piazza participation, determine the cutoff, and drop the lowest score at the end of the quarter.

In the spirit of the above, please ask questions as public questions on Piazza, if possible.
This way, your question, and the answer to your question, can help somebody else who might have the same question.
We will change questions asked privately to public, if we deem it appropriate.
If your question involves code you've written, or is about a personal issue, we will leave those private.
The same applies to emailed questions - we will redirect you to Piazza if appropriate.

Accommodations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Academic Misconduct
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Academic misconduct is a serious issue.
You can find the official UC Davis policy on the `Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs`_ website.

You are expected to *cite all of the work you reference*.
Any ideas that are not specifically yours or generally known (e.g., caches hold data) should have a citation.
When in doubt, cite.

The labs will be partner assignments.
Feel free to share ideas with other groups.
You may not share code or circuits, however.
If you're looking at another group's code or circuits, odds are that you've gone past simply sharing ideas.

Any violations of this policy will result in reporting the violating student(s) to the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs.
